# Explanation

## The Cat API Bot:
**Cats are cute, So I made a bot using python and TheCatAPI, it's simple for now, sometimes it'll repeat the same image on accident. it works good though. can't complain.**

## Multi Stuff Bot (Pleroma) 
**This is the code inside the Pleroma Folder.** 
First off, put your username inside settings.json and of you have a friend you can add it to the list, then make a ENV file called "auth_token" and put your token that you got [From This Website](https://tools.splat.soy/pleroma-access-token/) and start the replit, ***it uses Win95 Icons which if you're a staff member, you can go to the Pleroma API dashboard at:***
**https://your_instance.com/pleroma/admin/?#/settings/emoji**
Add "https://antiserious.us" as a remote pack and download "win 95"

**if you aren't an admin do this:**
