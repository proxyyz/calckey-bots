# Calckey + Pleroma API bots

This is just free to u use code to set up a bot on your calckey instance. 
If you'd like, you can credit me or leave a star. 

# Explanation

# The Cat API Bot:
Cats are cute, So I made a bot using python and TheCatAPI, it's simple for now because I h to fix some code, V2 will have the posting functions. 

# AITA Bot (pleroma):
This is still WIP, It'll be added to the repo after the cat one is done. 
It basically uses r/amitheasshole and scrapes posts, usernames, titles, descriptions and reposts it onto the pleroma instance.
